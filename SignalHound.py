		# BB_API bbStatus bbConfigureSweepCoupling(int device, double rbw, double vbw, double sweepTime, unsigned int rbwType, unsigned int rejection);

		# device  Handle to the device being configured.
		# rbw  	Resolution bandwidth in Hz. Use the bandwidth table in the appendix to
		# 		determine good values to choose. As of 1.07 in non-native mode, RBW
		# 		can be arbitrary. Therefore you may choose values not in the table and
		# 		they will not clamp.
		# vbw  Video bandwidth (VBW) in Hz. VBW must be less than or equal to RBW.
		# 		VBW can be arbitrary. For best performance use RBW as the VBW.
		# sweepTime  Sweep time in seconds.
		# 		In sweep mode, this value is how long the device collects data before it
		# 		begins processing. Maximum values to be provided should be around
		# 		100ms.
		# 		In the real-time configuration, this value represents the length of time
		# 		data is collected and compounded before returning a sweep. Values for
		# 		real-time should be between 16ms-100ms for optimal viewing and use.
		# 		In zero span mode this is the length of the returned sweep as a measure
		# 		of time. Sweep times for zero span must range between 10us and
		# 		100ms. Values outside this range are clamped.
		# rbwType  The possible values for rbwType are BB_NATIVE_RBW and
		# 		BB_NON_NATIVE_RBW. This choice determines which bandwidth table
		# 		is used and how the data is processed. BB_NATIVE_RBW is default and
		# 		unchangeable for real-time operation.
		# rejection  The possible values for rejection are BB_NO_SPUR_REJECT,
		# 		BB_SPUR_REJECT, and BB_BYPASS_RF.

		# The resolution bandwidth, or RBW, represents the bandwidth of spectral energy represented in each
		# frequency bin. For example, with an RBW of 10 kHz, the amplitude value for each bin would represent
		# the total energy from 5 kHz below to 5 kHz above the bin's center. For standard bandwidths, the API
		# uses the 3 dB points to define the RBW.
		# The video bandwidth, or VBW, is applied after the signal has been converted to frequency domain as
		# power, voltage, or log units. It is implemented as a simple rectangular window, averaging the amplitude
		# readings for each frequency bin over several overlapping FFTs. A signal whose amplitude is modulated at
		# Test Equipment Plus | 17
		# a much higher frequency than the VBW will be shown as an average, whereas amplitude modulation at
		# a lower frequency will be shown as a minimum and maximum value.
		# Native RBWs represent the bandwidths from a single power-of-2 FFT using our sample rate of 80 MSPS
		# and a high dynamic range window function. Each RBW is half of the previous. Using native RBWs can
		# give you the lowest possible bandwidth for any given sweep time, and minimizes processing power.
		# However, scalloping losses of up to 0.8 dB, occurring when a signal falls in between two bins, can cause
		# problems for some types of measurements.
		# Non-native RBWs use the traditional 1-3-10 sequence. As of version 1.0.7, non-native bandwidths are
		# not restricted to the 1-3-10 sequence but can be arbitrary. Programmatically, non-native RBW's are
		# achieved by creating variable sized bandwidth flattop windows.
		# sweepTime applies to regular sweep mode and real-time mode. If in sweep mode, sweepTime is the
		# amount of time the device will spend collecting data before processing. Increasing this value is useful for
		# capturing signals of interest or viewing a more consistent view of the spectrum. Increasing sweepTime
		# has a very large impact on the amount of resources used by the API due to the increase of data needing
		# to be stored and the amount of signal processing performed. For this reason, increasing sweepTime also
		# decreases the rate at which you can acquire sweeps.
		# In real-time, sweepTime refers to how long data is accumulated before returning a sweep. Ensure you
		# are capable of retrieving as many sweeps that will be produced by changing this value. For instance,
		# changing sweepTime to 32ms in real-time mode will return approximately 31 sweeps per second
		# (1000/32).
		# Rejection can be used to optimize certain aspects of the signal. Default is BB_NO_SPUR_REJECT, and
		# should be used in most cases. If you have a steady CW or slowly changing signal, and need to minimize
		# image and spurious responses from the device, use BB_SPUR_REJECT. If you have a signal between 300
		# MHz and 3 GHz, need the lowest possible phase noise, and do not need any image rejection,
		# BB_BYPASS_RF can be used to rewire the front end for lowest phase noise.

		# When this function returns successfully, the correction array will contain the frequency domain

		# temperature, gain, attenuation, and frequency. If any of these change, a new correction array should be
		# requested. The correction array will only be generated again on a new bbInitiate().
		# The correction arrays and returned values differ slightly depending on the 7 or 20 MHz bandwidth
		# chosen. Each one is described in depth below.

		# The correction array represents 40 MHz of bandwidth where frequencies outside the requested 20 MHz
		# are zeroed out. The first non-zero sample begins at corrections[index]. The frequency at this index is
		# startFreq. The bin size of each index is implied through 40 MHz divided by the length of the array,
		# (40.0e6 / 2048) = 19531.25 Hz. If an Fourier transform is applied on the IF data, the correction values
		# will line up with the usable 20 MHz bandwdith.
		# 7MHz
		# The correction array represents 10 Mhz of bandwdith where the usable 7 MHz is centered and all values
		# outside the usable 7 MHz is zeroed. The index returned is the first non zero sample in the array. The
		# startFreq returned is the frequency of the first sample in the array, corrections[0]. Every other sample’s
		# frequency can be determined with the bin size. The bin size for this array is (10.0e6 / 2048) = 4882.8125
		# Hz. If a complex Fourier Transform is applied to the IQ data, the correction values will line up with the
		# usable 7 MHz bandwidth.
		# Tips
		# Time domain corrections of the signal’s amplitude require two steps. First, an inverse Fourier Transform
		# must be performed on the entire correction array (including zero’ed portions). This results in a 4096
		# sample kernel. Second, the kernel is used in convolution with the time domain data. If a larger/smaller
		# kernel is desired, interpolate/extrapolate the correction array while it is in the frequency domain to the
		# desired length. Lengths which are powers of two are suggested.
		# Frequency domain correction of the signal’s amplitude requires you to first transform the raw data into
		# the frequency domain. Performing an Fourier transform on the incoming data will yeild a frequency
		# domain array that will align with the correction array. You can index the Transform results using the
		# index returned from this function if you wish or apply the whole array. Remember that the corrections
		# are in dB. If larger Transform sizes are desired, you can interpolate the correction array to the desired
		# size. (Be aware! This will change the index of the first non-zero correction, but the results of the FFT will
		# still align the with usable 20 MHz)

		# at initiate. The structure of the data is described in Modes of Operation:Raw Data. To ensure full
		# coverage the function must be called ~267 times with a 20 MHz bandwidth and ~67 with 7 MHz
		# bandwidth. Only 120ms of data is buffered before data loss occurs. Ensure no additional processing or
		# disk I/O is occuring in the same thread as the one acquiring the data to ensure no data loss.
		# The values returned in buffer represent full scale. For 32-bit floating point samples, the values range
		# from -1.0 to 1.0. For 16-bit signed short samples, the values range from -2 15 to 2 15 -1. Values at or near
		# the absolute max might indicate compression. Adjusting gain and attenuation is the best way to achieve
		# the most dynamic range of samples returned.
		# The triggers parameter can be null(0) if you are not interested in trigger position, otherwise triggers
		# should point to an array of 68 32-bit integers. Starting at triggers[0], positive values will indicate
		# positions within the returned buffer array where an external trigger occurred. The positions are zero
		# based, meaning the positions will be between 0 and 299007. (Note: the minimum trigger position
		# detected is approximately 90) If no triggers occurred during the acquisition of the raw data, all values

		# and make your own decisions on when to drop/ignore sweeps.
